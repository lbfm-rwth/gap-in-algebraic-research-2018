The aim of this "summer" school is to give an overview over the research software available in GAP.
The speakers will  present  their areas  of research,  the functionality  that is  available to
investigate these areas   computationally,  and   guide   participants  to   familiarize themselves
with  these tools  during the accompanying  programming lab sessions.
We aim to do 2 hours of programming lab session for each 1.5 hours of lecture time.
No prior computational experience is needed.
Alexander Konovalov will give a GAP tutorial at the beginning of the summer school.


The speakers are:
- Jan de Beule (Brussels), "Finite Geometry in GAP"
- Alexander Hulpke (Fort Collins), "Group Homomorphisms in GAP:
  Connecting and (De)composing Groups"
- Alexander Konovalov (St. Andrews), "Programming with GAP (A GAP Tutorial)"
- Sebastian Posur (Siegen), "The CAP Project: Category Theory in Computer Algebra"
- Madeleine Whybrow (Kaiserslautern), TBA
- Wilf Wilson (Halle), "Computing with semigroups in GAP"
