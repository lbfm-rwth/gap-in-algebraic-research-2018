We will use the framapad
[https://annuel.framapad.org/p/gap2018rwth](https://annuel.framapad.org/p/gap2018rwth)
to share links, snippets of code and to chat.

Slides and exercise materials will be uploaded here during the school.

## GAP Tutorial - Alexander Konovalov

* [Sofware Carpentry lesson "Programming with GAP"](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/)
* Demonstration of capabilities of the GAP Jupyter interface:
  - Try GAP in Jupyter [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter/master)
  - GAP package Francy [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gap-packages/francy/master)
  - GAP package JupyterViz [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nathancarter/jupyterviz/master?filepath=inst%2Fgap-4.9.3%2Fpkg%2Fjupyterviz%2Ftst%2Fin-notebook-test.ipynb)
* [Example of parallel distributed search in the Small Groups Library using the SCSCP package](https://github.com/alex-konovalov/scscp-demo)

## The CAP Project - Sebastian Posur
[Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/CAP-slides.pdf).

You can access the exercises here:
- Via [binder](https://github.com/sebastianpos/cap-aachen2018), click on the `launch binder` icon.
- As a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/homalg-project/capdays-2018/blob/gh-pages/materials/AbelianCategoriesZ.ipynb)
with exercises that don't use Singular.
- As a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/homalg-project/capdays-2018/blob/gh-pages/materials/Abelian%20Categories.ipynb)
with exercises that do use Singular. You need to have Singular installed.

## Majorana and Axial Algebras - Madeleine Whybrow

Here are the slides:
[slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Slides.pdf).
Here is the problem sheet:
[tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Tutorial.pdf).

If you are feeling confident and have completed the problem sheet (or as much of it as interests you)
then you can have a look at these additional problems:
[extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/Majorana-and-axial-algebras_Extension.pdf).

The MajoranaAlgebras package webpage can be found here:
